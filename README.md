### Description

EmergencyLS is an all-in-one configurable Emergency Lighting System for the popular Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) Modification, FiveM. We kept it simple, allowing generic ELS XML Configurations to work alongside our system.

The server-side element restricts controls to the driver and allows the driver to activate primary, secondary & warning lighting each with individually configurable key-bindings. Welcome to the best server-sided Emergency Lighting System for FiveM.
